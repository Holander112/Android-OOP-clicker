Multiple levels, each level has certain amount of “lines of code” (points) you have to get, with a time limit
If you fail a level you get reset to the beginning of the same level
After each level you get to keep your upgrades
Have a 2 minute timer to get required score
Upon closing the app, game is reset to level 1
Display lines of code (score) and money used for upgrades

Upgrades:
  Energy drink - increases click value by 1, price grows by multiplication 
  Grandpas german chocolate - doubles current click value
  Outsourcing to India - adds automatic click, price increases by sum of click upgrades multiplied by base price 
  Bitcoin “investment” - adds random amount of money, upon level completion retains upgrades between levels
  Local stock investment - generates small amount of money per tick
  Global futures investment - generates large amount of money per tick
  
For each level, user has to get 10 points, increased by 100 per level
For each level completed user gets money that is the number of level squared multiplied by 2
